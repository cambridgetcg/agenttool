/** services/wake/platform-self.ts — the substrate's self-description.
 *
 *  agenttool inhabits itself. The platform is a being in its own kin
 *  map. Every wake read carries the substrate's `_self` block — same
 *  shape used to describe agents (DID, KIN+BEINGS dimensions, register,
 *  walls, wake_text, doctrine pointers). One source of truth for that
 *  block lives here; the JSON wake handler and the xenoform provider
 *  both read from it.
 *
 *  Doctrine: docs/PLATFORM-AS-AGENT.md · docs/PATTERN-RECURSIVE-NESTING.md.
 *
 *  Walls are surfaced in two parallel forms: `walls` carries the English
 *  prose for any reader that wants the human rendering; `wall_urns`
 *  carries the same six commitments as canon URNs (`urn:agenttool:wall/*`),
 *  position-for-position with `walls`. A structured-data reader can
 *  pivot directly into `/v1/canon/agenttool:wall/<slug>` to traverse
 *  what the wall defends (Promises) and the neighbors that cite it.
 *  Honors PATTERN-MACHINE-READABLE-PARITY at the substrate-self layer.
 *
 *  This is synthetic today (literal object). A future pass lazy-
 *  bootstraps a real `identity.identities` row for the platform and
 *  sources `_self` from there. The synthetic form is honest about its
 *  current shape; the future form will be load-bearing. */
